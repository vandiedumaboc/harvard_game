## Gened 1188 ‚Äì Final Project: ‚ÄúThe Harvard Admissions Game 2050‚Äù

### üéÆ Premise of the game:
The game asks the player to simulate they‚Äôre a Harvard admissions officer in the year  
2050, where AIs can apply alongside humans. To avoid bias, the university has implemented an  
AI-blind admissions process, and so the player has to blindly accept or reject applicants from a  
pool of 10 short ‚ÄúWhy Harvard statements‚Äù. At the end, the game will tell the player how many  
students they accepted overall and what percentage was human vs AI.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Methods:
1. I started by coding the game website (HTML/Java script + css) with the help of ChatGPT  
4o. The premise of the game is explained on the landing page and each round is 10  
randomized cards.  

2. I asked 10 Harvard friends to give me a one-sentence description on why they wanted to  
attend Harvard when they were applying. I then asked ChatGPT 4o to do the same,  
prompting it to sound ‚Äúas natural and as prospective student-like as possible‚Äù. The  
prompts, in total, are 20, but the game will always choose 10 at random for each round.  

3. The names of the human students were concealed under fake names to avoid any of the  
test subjects to recognize any fellow student.  


4. As an extra step, I ran all prompts both separately and all together through an (free)  
online AI detector ([https://www.zerogpt.com/](https://www.zerogpt.com/)). It could not detect AI use for any single  
prompt when run separately. When run with all prompts at once, it only detected AI for ‚ÄúI  
chose Harvard because I wanted to connect with students from around the world and  
gain new perspectives that would deepen and enrich my education.‚Äù, which is a human  
prompt, and funnily enough, the one I wrote.

### ü§ñ AI-Usage:
- ChatGPT 4o: Code for the website, the 10 AI Prompts, fake names for students.  
- Subtitles on CapCut ‚Üí I was impressed by how accurately the subtitle feature fills in  
unclear audio using contextual clues  
- Eye contact on CapCut ‚Üí At the beginning of the video I was reading from a script.  
CapCut has an AI function to correct when you look away from the camera to makes it  
seem like you‚Äôre looking straight all the time.  
- Formatting this file for README

### üìö How it could be implemented in the class:
This semester we did the exercise of writing a proposal that integrates AI policy,  
distributional requirements, and an AI course as part of a Harvard education. As you could  
watch on the video, this experiment sparked some interesting conversation on the future of  
college admissions in the face of AI. It opens the floor for a similar exercise that addresses deep  
philosophical discussions. For instance, on one hand, the students on the video seemed to  
value human intelligence based on its essence, experience, and possession of feelings,  
conveying an idea of irreplaceability. However, when it came down to results, none of the four  
test subjects accepted more humans than AI‚Äôs. Additionally, in response to the final question,  
most students spoke against using AI for college admissions and rejected the notion of AI  
competing against humans. Their responses indicate some level of threat from AI competing  
against humans. Are we really that irreplaceable/intellectually superior in the long run?

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:  
- Asking people anything during reading week will generally result in a lot of rejections or  
not-their-most-thoughtful answers  
- The sample size is small both in terms of prompts (10 human prompts and 10 AI  
prompts) and in terms of players (4)  
- While the short length of the prompts makes the game playable, it is insufficient to  
realistically simulate the kind of material an admissions officer would typically review.  
- However, the ultimate goal of this experiment was to spark a conversation on how LLM  
models (ChatGPT 4o, in this case) are getting incredibly close to human-level,  
specifically addressing the impact on college admissions as we know them.
